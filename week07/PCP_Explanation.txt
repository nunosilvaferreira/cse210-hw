Programming with Classes Principles Explanation

1. Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
It simplifies complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem domain.

Use in Project: In my exercise tracking program, I created an abstract Activity base class that defined the common structure for all activities without implementing all methods. 
The abstract GetDistance(), GetSpeed(), and GetPace() methods established what all activities should do without specifying how.

Enabling Change: Abstraction makes the program more flexible because new activity types can be added by simply inheriting from Activity and implementing the required methods. 
The rest of the program can work with any activity through the abstract interface without knowing the specific implementation details.

2. Encapsulation
Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, and restricting direct access to some of an object's components. 
It's achieved through access modifiers like private and protected.

Use in Project: In my exercise classes, all member variables (like _distance in Running and _laps in Swimming) were declared private. 
Access to these variables was controlled through public methods like GetDistance().

Enabling Change: Encapsulation protects the internal state of objects and allows implementation details to change without affecting other parts of the program. 
For example, if we needed to change how swimming distance is calculated, we could modify the Swimming class without impacting any code that uses GetDistance().

3. Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class. 
It enables code reuse through parent-child class relationships where child classes inherit from parent classes.

Use in Project: The Running, Cycling, and Swimming classes all inherited from the Activity base class. 
They automatically gained the Date and Minutes properties and GetSummary() method while adding their own specific implementations of distance, speed, and pace calculations.

Enabling Change: Inheritance makes the program more flexible because common functionality only needs to be maintained in one place (the base class). 
Changes to shared features (like date formatting in GetSummary()) can be made in the base class and automatically propagate to all derived classes.

4. Polymorphism
Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
It enables one interface to be used for different underlying forms through method overriding and virtual methods.

Use in Project: The Activity class defined virtual methods that were overridden in each derived class. 
The program could call GetSummary() on any Activity object, and the appropriate version of GetDistance(), GetSpeed(), and GetPace() would be called based on the actual object type.

Enabling Change: Polymorphism makes the program more flexible because new activity types can be added without changing the code that processes activities. 
The main program can work with the Activity interface without knowing about specific activity types, making it easy to extend with new functionality.

Conclusion:
These four principles work together to create maintainable, flexible software. 
Abstraction defines what objects should do, encapsulation protects how they do it, inheritance establishes relationships between objects, and polymorphism allows different objects to be used interchangeably. 
In my exercise tracking program, these principles made it easy to add new activity types, modify calculations, and extend functionality without breaking existing code.
