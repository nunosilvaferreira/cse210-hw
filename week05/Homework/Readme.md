# Homework Assignment System

This project demonstrates the principle of inheritance in object-oriented programming by implementing a homework assignment system with a base class and two specialized assignment types.

## Project Structure

The solution consists of four main files:

1. **Assignment.cs** - Base class containing common assignment properties and methods
2. **MathAssignment.cs** - Derived class for math-specific assignments
3. **WritingAssignment.cs** - Derived class for writing-specific assignments
4. **Program.cs** - Main program demonstrating the functionality

## Key Features

- **Inheritance Implementation**: Shows proper use of class inheritance in C#
- **Code Reusability**: Common functionality centralized in base class
- **Specialized Behaviors**: Derived classes add type-specific methods
- **Data Encapsulation**: Demonstrates proper access control

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or VS Code
3. Build and run the program

The main program will demonstrate:
- Creating a basic assignment
- Creating a math assignment with textbook sections and problems
- Creating a writing assignment with titles

## Sample Output

----------------------------------------------
Samuel Bennett - Multiplication

Roberto Rodriguez - Fractions
Section 7.3 Problems 8-19

Mary Waters - European History
The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters
-----------------------------------------------

## Learning Objectives

This project helps understand:
- Base and derived class relationships
- Constructor chaining with `base()`
- Protected access modifier
- Method overriding (though not used in this simple example)
- The "is-a" relationship in inheritance

## Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extension
