Polymorphism Explanation.txt

Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (along with encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction). 
The word comes from Greek roots meaning "many forms," and in programming it refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors while sharing a common interface.

At its core, polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the actual object that's being worked with, even when those objects are accessed through a common parent class reference. 
This means we can write more general code that works with base classes, while still getting the specific behavior of derived classes.

One major benefit of polymorphism is that it makes code more flexible and maintainable. 
When we need to add new types of objects to our program, we can often do so without having to modify existing code that works with the base class. 
This follows the important "open-closed principle" - our code should be open for extension but closed for modification.

A practical application of polymorphism can be seen in my Eternal Quest program where different types of goals (simple, eternal, and checklist) all inherit from a base Goal class. 
The program treats them uniformly through the base class interface, but each type has its own specific behavior when recording events or calculating points.

Here's a code example from my program that demonstrates polymorphism:

// Base class method
public abstract class Goal {
    public abstract void RecordEvent();
}

// Derived class implementations
public class SimpleGoal : Goal {
    public override void RecordEvent() {
        _isComplete = true;
    }
}

public class EternalGoal : Goal {
    public override void RecordEvent() {
        _timesCompleted++;
    }
}

public class ChecklistGoal : Goal {
    public override void RecordEvent() {
        _amountCompleted++;
        if (_amountCompleted >= _target) {
            _isComplete = true;
        }
    }
}

In this example, all goal types implement the RecordEvent() method differently, but the calling code doesn't need to know which specific type it's dealing with 
- it can just call RecordEvent() on any Goal object and get the appropriate behavior. 
This makes the code cleaner and more adaptable to future changes.

Polymorphism is particularly valuable in large projects where requirements change frequently, as it helps create systems that are easier to extend and modify without breaking existing functionality. 
It's a powerful tool for writing flexible, maintainable object-oriented code.
